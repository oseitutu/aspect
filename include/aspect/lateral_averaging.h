   * LateralAveraging is a class that performs various averaging operations
   * on the solution.  The functions of this class take a vector as an argument.
   * The model is divided into depth slices where the number of slices is the
   * length of the output vector. Each function averages a specific quantity
   * (as specified by their name), and that quantity is averaged laterally
   * for each depth slice.

   * Plugins may access the LateralAveraging plugin through the SimulatorAccess
   * function get_lateral_averaging(), and then query that for the desired
   * averaged quantity.
