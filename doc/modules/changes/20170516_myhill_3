New: Aspect can now initialize the compositional field by supplying
a list of plugins and operators determining how each plugin modifies the
field. The operators are specified as a new input file parameter
'List of model operators', which takes a comma-separated list 
taken from the selection add, subtract, minimum and maximum. This list 
defaults to add if it is not given in the parameter file. If it is given, 
it may either be of length 1 (in which case all plugins modify the 
compositional field in the same way), or of the same length as 
'List of model names'.
