Changed: The material model interface now contains a base class for 
named additional outputs and a derived class that that can be filled 
with output for the seismic velocities in the evaluate() function. 
This replaces the member functions seismic_Vs and seismic_Vp in the
material model inteface, and can now be used to generate graphical 
output for other quantities as well. This change also removes the
postprocessors 'seismic_vp', and 'seismic_vs'. Instead there is a
postprocessor 'named additional outputs' that outputs all available
named output quantities. The file doc/update_prm_files_to_2.0.0.sed
was updated to modify parameter files to use the new postprocessor.
