New: Added functions to compute weighted p norm averages (Utilities::weighted_p_norm_average) 
and the derivatives of these weighted p norm averages (Utilities::derivative_of_weighted_p_norm_average) 
to namespace Utilities. The derivatives function is templated to be able to compute derivatives which 
are doubles and tensors.
