Changed: The names for all initial condition
plugins are now unified to the universal scheme 'initial_property' that
is planned for ASPECT 2.0.
This change is unfortunately incompatible with existing user plugins,
and existing parameter files. The provided scripts
doc/update_source_files_to_2.0.0.sed and doc/update_prm_files_to_2.0.0.sed
allow an easy conversion of existing plugins and parameter files to the
new naming scheme.
