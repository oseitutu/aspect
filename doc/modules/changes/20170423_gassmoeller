New: Initial temperature conditions can now be specified as a list
of plugins. Their initial temperatures are summed to generate the
final initial condition. For this purpose there is a new input file
parameter 'List of model names', and a new manager class that owns all
of the initial temperature plugins. Old input file parameters and the
Simulator access function 'get_initial_condition' have been deprecated.
