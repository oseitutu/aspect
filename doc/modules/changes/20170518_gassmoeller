New: The adiabatic initial conditions plugin 'initial profile' can now use a
reference function to initialize the composition, instead of using the initial
composition plugin. This is useful, if the initial composition plugin depends
on the adiabatic conditions and can therefore not be used for computing
the initial profile.
