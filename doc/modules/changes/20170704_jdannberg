New: Aspect now supports operator splitting as a new solver scheme. 
This allows it to decouple advection and reactions between 
compositional fields, and can also be used for temperature changes
related to these reactions. As part of this scheme, material models 
now have an optional additional output that computes reaction rates, 
and heating models have a new output that compute the corresponding 
rate of change in temperature. An example is given in a new cookbook.
