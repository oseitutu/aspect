Changed: The chunk geometry now removes the manifold id only from the boundaries and sets the correct
boundary objects for deal.II versions prior to version 9. For deal.II 9, only the manifold is used,
for which the push_forward_gradient function was implemented to compute the normal vectors. This way,
velocity anomalies along mesh refinement levels are removed.
