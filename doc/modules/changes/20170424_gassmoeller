Changed: The names for all boundary condition
plugins are now unified to the universal scheme 'boundary_property' that
is planned for ASPECT 2.0.
This change is unfortunately incompatible with existing user plugins, 
but the provided script doc/update_source_files_to_2.0.0.sed allows
an easy conversion of existing plugins to the new naming scheme.
Parameter files are not affected, because the naming of
subsections already follows the new structure.
