Changed: The global statistics information (time, timestep, degrees of
freedom, solver iterations), is now written at one point in a new
postprocessor 'global_statistics' instead of wherever they happened
to be available. This allows to control the order and format of the
columns in the statistics file, and fixes a bug in the statistics file,
in which data from later timesteps was written into lines
of previous timesteps in case of nonlinear solver schemes. Additionally,
the postprocessor by default now outputs only a single line per 
timestep also for nonlinear solver schemes. To restore the previous
behavior (one line per nonlinear iteration) there is a new input
parameter "Postprocess/Global statistics/Write statistics for each nonlinear
iteration". A consequence of this change is that statistics about
the initial refinement steps is only written if the "Mesh refinement/
Run postprocessors on initial refinement" parameter is set to true.
