Changed: ASPECT's 'particles' were initially introduced as 'tracers', 
and the naming scheme was never unified. In order to
use a more consistent and simpler to remember structure all remaining
references to 'tracers' have been replaced by 'particles'.
This change is unfortunately incompatible with existing user plugins,
and existing parameter files. The provided scripts
doc/update_source_files_to_2.0.0.sed and doc/update_prm_files_to_2.0.0.sed
allow an easy conversion of existing user plugins and parameter files to the
new naming scheme.
