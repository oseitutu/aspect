Changed: ASPECT's seismic anomalies post-processor produced spurious
anomalies as a result of laterally averaging velocities in depth slices,
and then smoothing slices. The new post-processor provides two options,
given by the Average velocity scheme variable. The option
reference profile provides a percentage anomaly relative to the
Vp and Vs calculated by evaluating the material model at the P-T
conditions given by adiabatic conditions. The lateral average provides
an anomaly relative to the laterally averaged velocity in the model at
that depth. This velocity is calculated by linear interpolation between
volumetric averages calculated within depth slices. The number of depth
slices in the domain is user-defined. This second option may give
odd results if there is a jump in seismic velocity not aligned with
the depth slices, so in general, the first option is preferred.
