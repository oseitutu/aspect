New: The dynamic topography postprocessor now uses the consistent
boundary flux method for computing surface stresses, which is
significantly more accurate. The postprocessor also exposes a method
for getting the dynamic topography vector, so that the visualization
and geoid postprocessors do not need to duplicate effort.
