New: A new particle property is added which indicates the presence of melt 
greater than the melt transport threshold at the particles position. If melt 
is not present a 0 is recorded. If melt is present a 1 is recorded. Only works
if there is a compositonal field named "porosity". A second new particle property
is also added which indicates the value for each compositional field. This can be 
used as a preliminary way to track the petrological evolution of material.
