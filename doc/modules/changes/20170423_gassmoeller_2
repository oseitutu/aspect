New: Initial composition conditions can now be specified as a list
of plugins. Their initial compositions are summed to generate the
final initial condition. For this purpose there is a new input file
parameter 'List of model names', and a new manager class that owns all
of the initial composition plugins. Old input file parameters and the
Simulator access function 'get_compositional_initial_condition' have been
deprecated. Note that there is no longer a default initial composition
(previously it was 'function'), but a plugin needs to be specified.
