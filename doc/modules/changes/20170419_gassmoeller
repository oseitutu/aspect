Changed: With a sufficiently new deal.II (9.0.0.pre),
the spherical shell geometry no longer uses boundary objects,
but lets the SphericalManifold class handle all geometry tasks.
Using older version of deal.II the manifold is used for mesh refinement, 
and boundary objects are used otherwise.
This results in improved meshes for the side boundaries of octants
of 3D spheres in both cases.
