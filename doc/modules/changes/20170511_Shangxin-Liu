New: ASPECT can now compute geoid in 3D spherical shell geometry. The geoid is 
calculated in spherical harmonic domain and the final results are transferred 
into spatial domain. The users can also choose to output the spherical harmonic 
coefficients of geoid, density contribution part, surface dynamic topography 
contribution part, and CMB dynamic topography contribution part respectively.
