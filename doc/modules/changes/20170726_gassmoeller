New: With a recent developer version of deal.II (9.0.0.pre) ASPECT can now
output particle data using deal.II functionality. This allows compressed vtu
output, and the same MPI I/O grouping options that are already available for
the visualization postprocessor. The ascii particle output format no longer 
exists and instead generates (nearly identically formatted) gnuplot output.
