@misc{Bangerth2017,
abstract = {This release includes the following changes:


	New: Choice between different formulations for the governing equations including Boussinesq and anelastic liquid approximation.
	New: Melt transport (two-phase flow).
	Particles: new generators, ghost exchange, performance improvements, interpolation to fields.
	New: Nondimensional material model for incompressible (using the Boussinesq approximation) and compressible computations (with ALA or TALA) for nondimensionalized problems. This can be used for benchmark problems like Blankenbach, King, etc..
	New: Optional DG method for temperature/composition.
	Adiabatic conditions: rework, now includes a reference density profile
	Free surface: overhaul.
	New cookbooks: continental extension, finite strain.
	New benchmarks: TanGurnis, Blankenbach, King.
	New: viscoplastic material model.
	Material model interface cleanup.
	Assembly performance improvements.
	New: memory statistics postprocessor.
	New: initial topography plugins.
	Many other fixes and small improvements.},
